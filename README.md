[hi](https://quotes-front-end.herokuapp.com/)

I became discouraged early in this bootcamp.  I find quotes from others to be uplifting and inspirational, so I thought I would make an app where people could add their favorite quotes.  Then they could also like quotes submitted by others.  Henry Ford said, "Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."  I thought I could.

This app is a MERN stack: Mongo, Express, React, node.js.

- When the user opens the app, a page will be displayed to enter a quote and an author.
- The user can then click on the "Add a Quote" button to have the quote and author dipslay on the page.
- The user can click on the "X" to delete the quote.
- The user can click on "Like" to like a quote.
- The user can double click the quote and it grays out to show it has been read.
- If the user double clicks on the quote again, it will become bold once again.

In the future, I want to add more styling!

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
